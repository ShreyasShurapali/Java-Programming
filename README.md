# Java Programming

My personal collection of Java projects, programming exercises, and Data Structures & Algorithms implementations.

## 🎯 About This Repository

This repo contains my hands-on Java learning journey - real projects built from scratch instead of just following tutorials. Each project represents practical implementation of core Java concepts and DSA topics.

## 📁 Current Projects

### **SimpleCalculator.java**
- **Concepts:** Variables, Scanner input, Switch statements, Error handling
- **Features:** Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), Division by zero protection
- **Status:** ✅ Complete and working

## 🛠️ What I'm Learning

**Java Fundamentals:**
- Variables and Data Types
- Control Structures (if/else, switch, loops)
- Methods and Functions
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Collections Framework

**Data Structures & Algorithms:**
- Arrays and String manipulation
- Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- Sorting and Searching algorithms
- Problem solving techniques

## 📈 Learning Approach

Breaking free from **tutorial hell** by:
- Building projects instead of endlessly watching tutorials
- Writing code from scratch, not copying
- Learning through actual implementation
- Testing and debugging real programs

## 🚀 Upcoming Projects

- Number Guessing Game (Loops & Random)
- Password Generator (Methods & Strings)
- Student Management System (OOP)
- Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Arrays)
- Basic Data Structure implementations

## 💻 How to Run

Each Java file can be compiled and run independently:
